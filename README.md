## About the Project
In today's digital age, streaming platforms offer an overwhelming selection of movies. To help users discover content that aligns with their tastes, recommendation systems play a crucial role. This certification project dives into the world of movie recommendation algorithms, exploring three main techniques:

Popularity-based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends popular movies based on user behavior, making it an excellent choice for new users.

Content-based Filtering: Suggests movies similar to those a user has previously enjoyed, focusing on movie attributes like genre, director, and cast.

User-based Filtering (KNN Algorithm): Utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm from the SciPy library to recommend movies based on user similarity, fostering a more personalized experience.

Whether you're interested in the theoretical underpinnings of recommendation systems or want to dive into the practical implementation, this project provides a hands-on learning experience.

## Implemented Recommendation Algorithms
* Popularity-based Collaborative Filtering: This algorithm recommends movies based on their overall popularity among users. It's a simple yet effective way to introduce users to popular titles.

* Content-based Filtering: Content-based recommendations leverage movie attributes to suggest similar films. If a user enjoys action movies, for instance, this algorithm will suggest other action-packed titles.

* User-based Filtering (KNN Algorithm): By implementing the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, this approach identifies users with similar movie preferences and suggests films they have enjoyed.

## Data
To build and evaluate the recommendation systems, we use a rich dataset containing movie information, user ratings, and more. This dataset has been carefully selected and preprocessed to facilitate the learning process and provide a comprehensive understanding of recommendation algorithms.


## Usage
Execute the project and provide your choice of interested movie name, genre name, so on as input and also provide number of recommendations you would like to have at the end.
