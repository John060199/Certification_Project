## About the Project
In today's digital age, streaming platforms offer an overwhelming selection of movies. To help users discover content that aligns with their tastes, recommendation systems play a crucial role. This certification project dives into the world of movie recommendation algorithms, exploring three main techniques:

Popularity-based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends popular movies based on user behavior, making it an excellent choice for new users.

Content-based Filtering: Suggests movies similar to those a user has previously enjoyed, focusing on movie attributes like genre, director, and cast.

User-based Filtering (KNN Algorithm): Utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm from the SciPy library to recommend movies based on user similarity, fostering a more personalized experience.

Whether you're interested in the theoretical underpinnings of recommendation systems or want to dive into the practical implementation, this project provides a hands-on learning experience.

## Implemented Recommendation Algorithms
Popularity-based Collaborative Filtering: This algorithm recommends movies based on their overall popularity among users. It's a simple yet effective way to introduce users to popular titles.

Content-based Filtering: Content-based recommendations leverage movie attributes to suggest similar films. If a user enjoys action movies, for instance, this algorithm will suggest other action-packed titles.

User-based Filtering (KNN Algorithm): By implementing the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, this approach identifies users with similar movie preferences and suggests films they have enjoyed.

## Data
To build and evaluate the recommendation systems, we use a rich dataset containing movie information, user ratings, and more. This dataset has been carefully selected and preprocessed to facilitate the learning process and provide a comprehensive understanding of recommendation algorithms.
